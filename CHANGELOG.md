# CHANGELOG

## Overview
The `README_PROFILE` file presents information related to my skills and experience in software engineering and offers various ways to get 
in touch with me. By utilizing adaptive graphic elements, this file adjusts to the user's preference for light or dark themes. 
The careful design aims not only to create a visually pleasing impression but also to clearly communicate key information about me.

This profile also highlights the technologies and frameworks I specialize in, providing a clear overview of my technical expertise. 
By including dynamic content, such as GitHub statistics, the README offers insights into my most-used programming languages and ongoing 
contributions. The file serves as both a professional introduction and a practical resource for those interested 
in collaborating or connecting with me in the software development community.
